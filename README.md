# logicAssistant
The aim of this project is to provide a tool for students learning propositional logic, that allows them to check their proofs. 

The underlying engine would be based either on natural deduction or equivalences.  
The tool would need to provide at least the following features:  
- Input of the steps of the proof  
- Checking that the steps are valid
